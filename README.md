### Get Involved
---
Right now, Open Sentra is on a mission to reshape cybersecurity — and you can be part of it.

Whether you’re a developer, researcher, security analyst, or simply passionate about sovereign technologies, there’s always room to contribute. We welcome ideas, code, and insights that can help build a smarter, safer digital future.
* Explore current issues and enhancements on our GitHub repositories
* Tackle beginner-friendly tasks tagged with "good first issue"
* Propose integrations, improvements, or new intelligence modules
* Collaborate directly through pull requests and discussions
* Suggest use cases or experimental deployments

> We believe cybersecurity is not a product — it’s a collective defense.
Open Sentra stands for openness, transparency, and collaboration.

While we don’t have a public website (yet), our GitHub is our headquarters. Everything starts here.

**Join the mission. Shape the future. Protect what matters.**
